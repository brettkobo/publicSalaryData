# United States Public Salary Data

I'm attempting to collect [public salary data from all 50 states](states.md), past or present
and I need your help. If you would like to contribute, feel free to create a
pull request and add the information you have.

You can add the following fields:

* State: The state that you are adding data for
* Link: A link to the website
* Government: If the link is from a government website or other site.
* Year: The last year the data was updated

If you are interested in writing a scraper that will help pull data from these
websites, feel free to open an issue and a pull request and we'll figure out
our next steps.
